# RCCGS-Algorithm-for-Frac-Length-Optimization
this file contains details needed to carry out the optimization process usibg the RCCGS Algorithm. M-files for the objective and constraint functions were created first. Then, the excel spreadsheet was used to generate random numbers following the Algorithm. For details, please, read the RCCGS Algorithm.m.
Other optimization tools were tried to check the feasibility of obtaining a nontrivial solution.
